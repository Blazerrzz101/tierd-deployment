# Tierd - Product Ranking Application (FULL DEPLOYMENT)

This is the FULL deployment version of the Tierd application, with all necessary fixes applied to ensure successful deployment on Vercel.

## üö® CRITICAL FIXES FOR DEPLOYED APPLICATION

If you encounter issues with your deployed Vercel application, follow these steps to fix them:

1. **Fix Voting System** - The most critical issue is the 500 error when voting, caused by file system restrictions in serverless environments:
   - Visit `/fix-voting` on your deployed site
   - Click "Apply Migration" to update your Supabase database with the necessary functions
   - This will allow votes to be stored in the database instead of the filesystem

2. **Fix Profile/Product Page "/undefined" Issues**:
   - We've updated the codebase to properly handle undefined slugs and usernames
   - The profile page now redirects to the sign-in page when not authenticated
   - Product pages with invalid slugs redirect to the products listing

3. **Ensure User Authentication Persistence**:
   - We've added robust auth state handling with automatic profile creation
   - Users are now properly tracked in the profiles table
   - Online status and last seen timestamps are maintained

4. **Server-Side Rendering Compatibility**:
   - Fixed issues with SSR/SSG by making components properly handle both client and server contexts

## ‚úÖ PROOF OF SUCCESSFUL BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT

The application has been successfully fixed and tested with the following proof:

1. **Local Build Success**: 
   - The application builds successfully with `npm run build`
   - All errors related to buttonVariants, React references, and utility functions have been fixed

2. **Local Server Test Success**:
   - Server starts successfully with `npm run start`
   - Health check endpoint at `/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-03-18T00:22:48.621Z"}`
   - No React reference errors, URL parsing issues, or missing utility functions

3. **Applied Fixes**:
   - Fixed `buttonVariants` function in Button component
   - Added proper utility functions (formatPrice, formatTimeAgo, normalizeProduct, generateSlug)
   - Fixed URL parsing in API calls
   - Added database migrations for voting system

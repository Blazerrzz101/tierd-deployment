# Expanded Product Catalog

This document outlines the implementation and usage of the expanded product catalog feature in the Tierd application.

## Overview

The expanded product catalog significantly enhances the Tierd application by adding a robust selection of products across all gaming peripheral categories. Key features include:

- **80+ Products:** At least 20 products in each of the four main categories (monitors, mice, keyboards, headsets)
- **Detailed Specifications:** Each product includes comprehensive specifications relevant to its category
- **Consistent Structure:** All products follow the same data structure for seamless integration
- **Dedicated API:** A separate API endpoint for expanded products to avoid disrupting existing functionality
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy browsing and filtering by category

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

- **Generator Utilities:**
  - `utils/product-expander.ts` - Core utility to expand the product database
  - `utils/product-categories/monitors.ts` - Monitor products generator
  - `utils/product-categories/mice.ts` - Mice products generator
  - `utils/product-categories/keyboards.ts` - Keyboard products generator
  - `utils/product-categories/headsets.ts` - Headset products generator

- **API:**
  - `app/api/products/expanded-route.ts` - API endpoint for expanded products

- **UI Components:**
  - `components/products/expanded-product-list.tsx` - Component to display expanded products
  - `components/products/category-filter.tsx` - Filter for product categories
  - `components/ui/loading-spinner.tsx` - Loading indicator

- **Pages:**
  - `app/expanded-catalog/page.tsx` - Page to display the expanded catalog

### Data Structure

Each product follows this structure:

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  price: number;
  url_slug: string;
  image_url: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  specifications: Record<string, string>;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  rating: number;
  review_count: number;
  reviews: [];
  threads: [];
  upvotes: number;
  downvotes: number;
  score: number;
  rank: number;
}
```

## Usage

### Viewing the Expanded Catalog

Users can access the expanded catalog through:
1. The "Expanded Catalog" link in the main navigation
2. Directly navigating to `/expanded-catalog`

### API Access

For developers, the expanded product data can be accessed via:

- `GET /api/products/expanded` - Returns all expanded products
- `GET /api/products/expanded?category=monitors` - Returns products filtered by category

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the expanded catalog include:

1. Adding product images and ensuring they are accessible
2. Implementing advanced filtering and sorting options
3. Adding user reviews specific to expanded products
4. Creating a comparison feature for products in the same category
5. Adding affiliate marketing links to purchase products

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the expanded catalog:

1. Verify API responses in the browser console
2. Check that all product generators are properly imported
3. Ensure the expanded-route.ts file is using the correct type casting for products
4. Verify that the UI components are properly displaying the data

## Conclusion

The expanded product catalog significantly enhances the Tierd application's value proposition by providing users with a comprehensive selection of gaming peripherals to explore and compare. This feature demonstrates the scalability of the Tierd platform and lays the groundwork for future enhancements.

# Product Detail Page Standardization

This document outlines the standardization of product detail pages across the application, ensuring a consistent user experience and fixing 404 errors.

## Key Improvements

1. **Unified Product Detail Component**
   - Created a single, robust `UnifiedProductDetail` component for all product detail pages
   - Ensured consistent styling, features, and behavior across all product pages
   - Simplified maintenance by centralizing changes to a single component

2. **URL Structure Standardization**
   - Migrated from multiple URL patterns (IDs and slugs) to a single slug-based approach
   - Improved slug generation with better handling of special characters
   - Added redirect handling for old URL formats to prevent 404 errors

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Added affiliate marketing links to product detail pages
   - Integrated with high-quality product images from Best Buy when available
   - Added support for multiple product images with gallery view
   - Added similar products recommendations
   - Improved product specifications display

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added robust loading states with skeleton UI
   - Created better 404 handling with product suggestions
   - Enhanced API endpoints to handle various slug formats and fallbacks

## Directory Structure

The standardized structure for product pages now includes:

- `/app/products/[slug]/page.tsx` - The main dynamic route for all products
- `/app/products/legacy/[slug]/page.tsx` - A redirect handler for legacy ID-based URLs (moved to avoid route conflicts)
- `/components/products/unified-product-detail.tsx` - The unified product detail component

## Implementation Details

### URL Generation

All product URLs are now generated using the `createProductUrl` function in `utils/product-utils.ts`:

```javascript
export function createProductUrl(product) {
  const slug = getValidProductSlug(product);
  return `/products/${slug}`;
}
```

The `getValidProductSlug` function ensures that all products have valid, consistent URL slugs:

```javascript
export function getValidProductSlug(product) {
  // Use existing url_slug if available
  if (product?.url_slug && product.url_slug !== 'undefined') {
    return product.url_slug;
  }
  
  // Generate from name
  if (product?.name) {
    return slugifyString(product.name);
  }
  
  // Generate from ID as fallback
  if (product?.id) {
    return `product-${product.id.substring(0, 8)}`;
  }
  
  return "unknown-product";
}
```

### Dynamic Product Loading

The dynamic `[slug]` route now handles product loading with a consistent approach:

1. Try to find the product by slug in client-side data
2. If not found, fetch from the API
3. Show loading skeleton during fetch
4. Display 404 if product cannot be found

### Improved Slug Matching

The `findProductBySlug` function provides robust matching with multiple fallbacks:

1. Try direct slug match
2. Try case-insensitive match
3. Try alternative slugs
4. Try matching with generated slug
5. Try normalized version of the slug
6. Try matching by product ID

### Legacy URL Handling

We've moved the legacy ID-based URL handler to a separate route (`/products/legacy/[slug]`) to avoid Next.js dynamic route conflicts. This handler:

1. Checks if the provided parameter matches a legacy product ID
2. If found, redirects to the new slug-based URL
3. If not found, redirects to the main products page

## Testing URL Changes

To verify that all product URLs work correctly:

1. Use the main navigation to browse to different product categories
2. Click on product cards from the home page
3. Use the search functionality to find products
4. Try legacy URLs (e.g., `/products/legacy/logitech-g502`) to ensure they redirect properly
5. Test direct slug URLs (e.g., `/products/logitech-g502-x-plus`)

## Conclusion

This standardization effort ensures a consistent, error-free experience across all product detail pages, reducing 404 errors and improving the overall user experience. It also simplifies future maintenance by centralizing the product detail UI to a single component.

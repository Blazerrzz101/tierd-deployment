# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons
- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When encountering "X is not a function" errors during build, check not only function implementations but also export patterns
- Prefer dedicated component/hook files over multi-purpose files to avoid circular dependencies

## Pre-Deployment Testing (2024-05)
- Implement a comprehensive pre-deployment test suite to validate key functionality
- Test production builds separately from development builds to catch build-specific issues
- Use scripts to automate checking for broken links and routing issues
- Validate schema.org markup for SEO benefits on product pages

- Include test documentation in PRE_DEPLOYMENT_TESTS.md
- Run the full suite with `npm run precheck` before deployment
- Integrated the test suite with npm scripts for easy access

## Authentication Provider Fix (2024-03-25)
- Always ensure component names in imports match the exact exported name in the source file
- When dealing with authentication providers, naming is especially critical for proper functionality
- For Next.js applications, components referenced in providers.tsx must be correctly imported
- Component naming issues often manifest as "is not a function" or "expected a string/function but got undefined" errors
- Enhanced error detection by checking the exact error message in the console/browser
- Middleware enhancements with custom headers help identify authentication state issues more easily

## Voting System And Auth State Fixes
- When integrating with Supabase RPC functions, always verify parameter order carefully
- Include fallback logic when calling external APIs to handle potential parameter order issues
- Make SQL function definitions flexible to handle slightly different parameter orders
- Avoid duplicate hook implementations by using consistent export naming
- Use comprehensive test pages to validate complex interactions like auth + voting
- Include documentation about fixes in VOTING_SYSTEM_FIX.md for future developers
- When encountering build errors with "is not a function", consider moving the implementation to a dedicated file
- Use the `export const functionName = () => {}` pattern instead of `export function functionName() {}` for React hooks to ensure consistent compilation

## Authentication System Fixes
- Avoid having multiple authentication providers in the same application
- Ensure consistent auth hook naming and implementation to prevent state inconsistencies
- When using localStorage for auth state, ensure proper clearing on sign-out
- Use a consistent method for determining loading states across components 
- Always check for undefined or null user states before accessing user properties
- In Next.js applications, be careful with duplicate providers in app layout
- Prefer a single source of truth for auth state to avoid conflicts
- Use descriptive variable names for loading states to avoid naming conflicts
- After refactoring, make sure to update ALL import paths to prevent "is not a function" runtime errors
- When deprecating components, add comments to guide developers to the new implementation 

## URL Generation and Navigation Fixes
- Never directly construct URLs using string interpolation (e.g., `/products/${productId}`)
- Always use dedicated utility functions for URL generation to prevent inconsistencies
- When creating URLs from user-generated content, always sanitize and validate inputs
- Implement fallback mechanisms for missing/invalid slugs to prevent broken links
- Use types and interfaces to ensure proper parameter passing in URL-related functions
- Add debug logging for URL generation to quickly identify issues
- When implementing redirects, use a short delay to ensure auth state is settled
- Track timing information to identify authentication and loading state issues 
- Use Next.js middleware as a safety net to catch any malformed URLs that might slip through
- Always validate slugs before using them in URL construction
- Add comprehensive testing for URL generation and navigation

## Product Detail Page Fixes (2024-05)
- When extending a type, prefer using type intersection (Type1 & Type2) over extends when dealing with potentially conflicting property requirements
- Import from consistent sources to avoid circular dependencies
- When handling product data, ensure all products have valid slugs before using them in URLs
- Add detailed logging to help troubleshoot issues in production
- Use type assertions carefully and only when necessary to bridge type mismatches
- When dealing with API responses that might change over time, add backward compatibility handling

- Test API endpoints with curl before testing frontend pages to isolate issues
- Ensure consistent property names across mock data and interfaces to prevent type errors

## Product Detail Page UI Consistency Fixes (2024-05)
- Ensure all product URL slugs follow the same format (preferably based on the complete product name)
- Keep category IDs consistent between UI components and data files
- When working with multiple UI implementations, watch for URL pattern differences that might trigger different component rendering
- Maintain ID consistency across related data structures (e.g., productImages, product objects)
- Test URL formats directly with curl to diagnose routing and component rendering issues
- When pages have different appearances for the same type of content, verify URL patterns and slugs first

## Rankings Page Implementation (2024-05)
- When implementing different view modes (grid vs. list), use conditional classes with the cn utility
- For affiliate marketing integration, create dedicated utility files to map products to external identifiers
- When handling image loading, always provide fallback images for products without custom images
- Use utility functions to handle inconsistent data formats (e.g., getUserVoteType helper)
- When dealing with multiple interfaces for the same concept (like VoteType), create adapter functions
- Add user feedback through loading states, badges, and visual indicators
- Use motion components from framer-motion to add subtle animations to list items
- For responsive designs, ensure both desktop and mobile views are well-handled
- When displaying ratings, consider using filled stars for better visual representation

# Tools

## Screenshot Verification
The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:
1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT] ```
2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png ```

## Next.js Dynamic Route Conflicts (2024-05)
- Next.js does not allow different parameter names for dynamic routes at the same level (`[id]` vs `[slug]`)
- When encountering "You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path" error, options are:
  - Use the same parameter name in all routes at the same level
  - Move one of the conflicting routes to a different path level
  - Use catch-all routes (`[...slug]`) if appropriate
  - Implement middleware to handle redirection before routes are processed
- For legacy URL support, prefer creating a dedicated subdirectory (e.g., `legacy/[parameter]`)
- Document URL structure changes to ensure developers understand the routing hierarchy
- Test all redirects to ensure backward compatibility with old URLs
